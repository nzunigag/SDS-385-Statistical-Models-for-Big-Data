# Peer Review

During this course, we need to provide an evaluation of other students' assignments. Also, my assignments are evaluated by other students and they will provide me feedback regarding my math or my code. 

- My reviews to other students can be found in [Peer Reviewer](Peer-Reviewer). 
- Other sudents evaluation of my assignments can be found in [Peer Reviewed](Peer-Reviewed).

## Peer Review #1
Here are the pairings (or three-cycles) for peer review #1:

R (7)
- Mauricio & Yinan
- Natalia & Yanxin Li
- Ciara reviews Hyunsang reviews Rimli reviews Ciara

Python (5)
- Amin & Tony
- Bowen reviews Ashutosh reviews Aaron reviews Bowen

# Peer Review #2
Here are the pairings (or three-cycles) for peer review #2:

R (7)
- Mauricio & Rimli
- Yinan & Ciara
- Yanxin reviews Hyunsang reviews Natalia reviews Yanxin

Python (5)
- Amin & Bowen
- Tony reviews Aaron reviews Ashutosh reviews Tony

## Professor's indications

Here I show the indications given by the professor regarding the peer review process:

### How should I turn this in?

Please post peer reviews up on GitHub and e-mail your review-ee a link (CCing both me and Su).

### How long should this take?

Probably a couple of hours, but if you're learning a lot, definitely spend more time. Remember, a big part of how you're graded in this class is how you help others learn.


### What should I do, knowing that my stuff will be peer reviewed? 

Organize your code in a way that is fit for public consumption. Make it clean, readable, and well-commented/well documented. If you create a README.md file in your directory, you can use Markdown to document your code (just like you see on the course homepage). Here's a good example of a README that provides some nice documentation, written by a student I worked with who graduated last year and went to a postdoc at Columbia:

Here in the early part of the course, you're writing stuff that does relatively simple things, so it's not necessary to go overboard with documentation. But do practice getting the basics right from the beginning. A very important part of being a data scientist is writing readable code that others can use to solve their own problems.

As for coding style: while many things are a matter of convention, some choices will make your code more readable than others. Below are a couple of "R Style Guideline" documents. While these represent someone's opinion, it's worth asking yourself whether your own code would be more readable and maintainable if you followed something similar:
http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml

(These are R-focused, but the same principle of readable code applies for Python, of course.)


### What should I cover in a peer review?

The short answer is: anything that will be helpful regarding the math or code. You can choose to look broadly at a person's body of work over the course of a few weeks, or you can zoom in and look at something quite narrow. Regardless of where you focus your energies, you should make "macro" comments about the overall approach, coding style, readability of the code, etc. You should also strive to make some micro comments about where you see room for improvement. If you think there's a better way to handle something, bring it up. Sometimes this might take the form of a mini benchmarking exercise. For example, we've had discussions in class about whether some particular module in code was as efficient as another possible way of doing the same thing. A great "micro"-level thing to do in a peer review would be to actually benchmark that module versus the plausible alternative. This would provide very concrete feedback to someone on the efficiency of some part of their code.

And of course, mention good things, too. If you learned something from carefully examining the other person's approach, make sure to say so! That's an important part of peer review. People like learning that they've done a good job, and I can tell from the class presentations that many people have been doing good jobs.
